This dataset comes from the Lingspam Dataset, 
specifically, the lemm-stop subset. The emails have been
edited to remove punctuation and standalone numbers.
The "Subject" word that begins each email has been removed.
Additionally, all tabs and newlines have been 
collapsed to a single space.

The original dataset can be found here:
