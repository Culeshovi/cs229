Machine Learning Algorithms


These Machine Learning Algorithms are written in Python using simple libraries like matplotlib, numpy, pandas and scipy.
I have written these algorithms by following the course of Standford University CS229 by Andrew Ng.
You can know more about the course by going through this website http://cs229.stanford.edu/ and it is also available on youtube
