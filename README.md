# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the sub field of computer science and subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI). It is basically giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 


These algorithms are written in Python by using simple libraries like matplotlib, numpy, pandas and scipy.
They are written by following the course cs229 of Standford University. The instructor of this course is Andrew Ng, who is VP & Chief Scientist of Baidu; Co-Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera; and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University.
